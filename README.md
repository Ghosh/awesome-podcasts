# Awesome Podcasts

> Podcasts for designers, developers, product managers, entrepreneurs, startups etc.


**Note**  
Due to the nature of podcasts, it is difficult to group them into separate categories. The boundaries between them are blurred and while I have tried my best, there is bound to be some overlap. You may find a podcast in the design category which also talks about lifestyle and business. Incase you disagree with the categorization and feel that it belongs to a different category please feel free to open an issue here. Pull requests are most welcome.
